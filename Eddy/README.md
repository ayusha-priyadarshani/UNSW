## Problem
Your task in this assignment is to write a Python program eddy.py which implement the Eddy editing commands described below.

Eddy editing commands are a simple subset of the important tool Sed which you met earlier in the course.

Sed is a very complex program that has many commands.
Eddy contains only a few of the most important Sed commands.
There are also some simplifying assumptions below, which make your task easier.

You must implement Eddy in Python only.

This assignment aims to give you:

- practice in Python programming generally.
- a clear and concrete understanding of sed's core semantics.
