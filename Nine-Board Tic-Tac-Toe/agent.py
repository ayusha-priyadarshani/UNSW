#   QUESTION: Briefly describe how your program works, including any algorithms and data structures employed, =
#   and explain any design decisions you made along the way. 
#
# ==========================================================================================================================================================>
#   
# _________________________________________________________________________ANSWER:___________________________________________________________________________
#   Our program combines Alpha-Beta pruning with logic, object-oriented programming, and data structure functionality to create 
#   an artificially intelligent agent which can defeat other agents with above-average to good intelligence. 
#   Several classes along with data structures like 2D arrays and lists have been used to store the current board and game state information.
#
# _____________________________________________________________________IMPLEMENTATION:_______________________________________________________________________
#
#   The algorithm begins by evaluating the state of the current board. For every turn of the agent, 
#   a copy of the original board is made, and the best move is found by calculating efficiency of each legally allowed play on that board. 
#
#   We use Minimax, as explained above, and a custom-designed scoring logic to determine the most optimal move by finding all future moves 
#   post committing a move to the current board and assigning it a score based on how well its subtrees perform. 
#   We do this for all possible moves and choose the move with the highest score, as the agent will have a higher chance of winning by proceeding 
#   down the subtree.
#
#   This is repeated till the opponent wins or a move by the agent on the current board forms a winning combination, leading to the agent winning.
#
# ____________________________________________________________________SCORE CALCULATON:______________________________________________________________________
#
#   We calculate the score of each board by weighing the number of marks placed by the agent and the number of marks placed by the opponent against 
#   the 8 possible tic-tac-toe winning combinations. 
#   The frequency and placement of marks in each row and column total out to a temporary score which gets added to the final score of the board.
#
#   Agent and opponent scores are initialised to zero.
#
#   Assume the board is
#
#    X X O
#    . . .
#    X O . 
#
#   While checking for 3 in a row, for example in row 1, for every instance of the agentâ€™s mark, the temporary score is increased by 10 times the
#   previous score. 
#   The first X increases the score to 10, while the second one increases it to 100. 
#   However, the third place is occupied by the opponent so the first and second marks are nullified since the combo can not be completed.
#
#   For column 1, the two Xs add on to weigh 100 and are added to the final score.
#
#   For row 3, the X and O get cancelled out so the final total score of the board is 100.
