## Problem

You are going to implement Pushy, a simple but powerful subset of the version control system Git.

Your task in this assignment is to write 10 shell scripts named pushy-init pushy-add pushy-commit pushy-log pushy-show pushy-rm pushy-status pushy-branch pushy-checkout pushy-merge.

Each of these script implements a simplified version of the corresponding Git command.

Git is a very complex program that has many individual commands. You only have to implement simplified equivalents of some core commands.

You are given a number of simplifying assumptions which make your task much easier.

Interestingly, large parts of early versions of Git were implemented in Shell.

This assignment aims to give you:
- practice in Shell programming generally
- a clear concrete understanding of Git's core semantics
