This project is based on a popular puzzle, variously known as "Hashiwokakero", "Hashi" or "Bridges". You will need to write a program to solve this puzzle, and provide a brief description of the algorithm and data structures you have used. The input to your program will be a rectangular array of numbers and dots, for example:

Each number represents an "island", while the dots represent the empty space (water) between the islands. Numbers larger than 9 are indicated by 'a' (10), 'b' (11) or 'c' (12). The aim is to connect all the islands with a network of bridges, satisfying these rules:
1. all bridges must run horizontally or vertically
2. bridges are not allowed to cross each other, or other islands
3. there can be no more than three bridges connecting any pair of islands
4. the total number of bridges connected to each island must be equal to the number on the island
